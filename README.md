## Methodology
I will be using an incremental approach and borrowing some methods from agile as it will allow me to create the minimum product first, and then add “richness” to the project by adding more and more features. There will be sprints, every 2 – 4 weeks, where I will work on a certain functionality of the game, mainly the most important ones first that need to be in the game. Later, if all the important mechanics/functionalities have been completed to a high standard, I can work on add more additions to the game to make it more fleshed out. After all the sprint cycles have been complete, I should have a complete video game

## Basic Functionalities
* **Jump (Space bar)** – To progress through one of the paths, early in the game, the player will need to jump over a ledge or a gap. 
* **Attack (M1)** – Once the player crafts the spear, there will be an obstacle in the way such as a thick bush, or weak wood that the player will have to attack to progress.
* **Sprint (Shift)** – Text box appears on screen informing player to press ‘Shift’. 
* **Choosing bugs (Left & Right key, Enter)** – When a player finds a log, picture of bug will come up prompting player to choose if they would like to eat the bug or not. They will use arrow keys to move left and right and enter to choose option.
